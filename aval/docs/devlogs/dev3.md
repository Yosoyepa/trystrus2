# Devlog — Dev 3 · API backend (kernel: identity + merchant service)

Mission: every API surface exists — mandates with passkeys, escalations,
catalog + MCP tools, checkout, PayPal rail — and VuelaYa verifies the mandate
BEFORE charging. Scope and day plan:
[`../PLAN-PARALELO.md`](../PLAN-PARALELO.md) §3. Entry protocol:
[`README.md`](README.md) — newest first, every PR.

## 2026-08-29 — workstream opened at M0 freeze
- **Why:** contracts v1.0 are frozen; this log exists so nobody re-solves what Dev 3 already solved.
- **Decision:** none yet. Starting points:
  [`../../DECISIONS.md`](../../DECISIONS.md) #2 (mandate), #3 (passkey),
  #4 (revocation + token DELETE), #8 (PayPal sandbox), #15 (keys).
  Interfaces: `schemas.md` §3 (`MandateRegistry`, `PaymentRail`).
- **Contracts touched:** none.
- **Tests I own:** T2 (SD-JWT), T8 (state machine), T14 (webhooks), T17
  (rail); T18 (dispute) jointly with Dev 2. This is the heaviest lane
  (decision #19 names the mitigations: catalog → Dev 1, checkout → Dev 2
  after M1).
- **Open questions:** none.
